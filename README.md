to know more on FPGA and ASIC.

Our Propitiatory Anasim Processor is improved upon RISC-V and extended
with DSP and AI capabilities. The Aansim Processor is aimed at AI and
DSP related applications at cloud, in IoT and Edge Devices. Visitors can
expect several regularly updated DSP examples with VHDL codes under GPL
License in this repository soon.
